# Bledsoe-Investment-Management-Algo-Simulator-Algorithm-Framework-
Bledsoe Investment Management Simulator (BIM) without incorporating blockchain technologies while maintaining its comprehensive and innovative nature.
. Algorithmic Framework Overview
The BIM Algorithmic Framework is designed to:

Capture Key Performance Metrics: Measure athletic performance using the Tech+Ball system, focusing on:

Distance (D)

Speed (S)

Force (F)

Number of Catches (C)

Number of Passes (P)

Ball Strips (BS)

Mid-Air Steals (MAS)

Normalize and Weight Metrics: Normalize each metric to a common scale (0–1) and assign weighted importance. The composite Performance Score (PS) is computed using weighted aggregation.

Convert Performance into Currency Valuation: Translate the Performance Score into token rewards using the BIM Coin and BIMX Coin dual-currency model. BIMX Coins can serve fans for in-app purchases, while BIM Coins drive athlete performance rewards. The inter-currency conversion module ensures dynamic liquidity.

Generate Trading Signals: Analyze Performance Score trends using moving averages and momentum indicators to issue buy/sell signals for BIM Coins within the performance trading simulation.

2. Updated Algorithm Steps & Formulas
Step 1: Data Normalization
Each metric 
𝑋
 (e.g., Distance, Speed, etc.) is normalized to ensure compatibility across various data types:

𝑋
norm
=
𝑋
−
𝑋
min
𝑋
max
−
𝑋
min
Example: If Distance (
𝐷
) ranges between 
𝐷
min
 and 
𝐷
max
, then:

𝐷
norm
=
𝐷
−
𝐷
min
𝐷
max
−
𝐷
min
This is repeated for Speed (
𝑆
norm
), Force (
𝐹
norm
), Catches (
𝐶
norm
), Passes (
𝑃
norm
), Ball Strips (
𝐵
𝑆
norm
), and Mid-Air Steals (
𝑀
𝐴
𝑆
norm
).

Step 2: Composite Performance Score (PS)
Using assigned weights (
𝑤
𝑖
) for normalized metrics:

𝑤
1
: Distance (15%)

𝑤
2
: Speed (15%)

𝑤
3
: Force (20%)

𝑤
4
: Catches (10%)

𝑤
5
: Passes (10%)

𝑤
6
: Ball Strips (15%)

𝑤
7
: Mid-Air Steals (15%)

The PS formula aggregates the weighted metrics:

Step 3: Performance to Reward Mapping
Define a threshold 
𝑇
 (e.g., 0.8) for token rewards. Compute rewards (
𝑅
) as:

𝑅
=
max
⁡
(
0
,
𝑃
𝑆
−
𝑇
1
−
𝑇
)
For PS 
≥
 T, fractional or full BIM Coins are rewarded to players. Conversion factors further refine token allocation.

Step 4: Token Conversion Model
In the dual-currency system:

𝑉
BIM
: Base value of BIM Coin.

𝑉
BIMX
: Base value of BIMX Coin.

The exchange ratio enables inter-token conversion without blockchain dependencies:

𝐸
=
𝑉
BIM
𝑉
BIMX
Step 5: Trading Signals Generation
Using historical PS data, moving averages (
𝑀
𝐴
) detect trends:

𝑀
𝐴
𝑡
=
1
𝑛
∑
𝑖
=
𝑡
−
𝑛
+
1
𝑡
𝑃
𝑆
𝑖
Buy and sell signals are triggered based on deviations:

Buy Signal: 
𝑃
𝑆
𝑡
>
𝑀
𝐴
𝑡
×
(
1
+
threshold
)

Sell Signal: 
𝑃
𝑆

<
𝑀

(

)
